# _WEB_SCRAPPING_
This Python script scrapes laptop data from an e-commerce site, extracting details such as product names, prices, descriptions, and reviews. It handles multiple pages using pagination and stores the data in lists. Finally, the script compiles the information into a Pandas DataFrame, allowing easy analysis or export to a CSV file.
